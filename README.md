<h> RIVER GANGA HEALTH </h>

<pre>so i have made a basic webapplication which helped me to learn file structure and basic js for backend 
           There is still a lot to learn but now  I  can create backend which uses static json files for database and work on that 
              This project focuses on WQI which is water quality index  AS we are taking AQI very seriously these days but nobody talks about water
        comeON !! I know we can die if we don't breath for few minutes but without water we can die within few days ,
 so why wait for that come to my sight look at the health of river ganga  </pre>

 <h2>FUTURE PLAN</h2>

 <pre>As i learn more backend and other skills i will try my best to add more features like geo json , a function which allows to add more data 
      I will also shift towards postgresSQL and make more dashbords , i want to make a web app where we all can help our NATION by giving small contibution
   thats it 
     
 
          sorry if it seemed boring as this is my point and i wanted to keep it ai free unlike my frontend   </pre>
